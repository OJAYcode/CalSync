# 🔧 Duplicate Route Fix - Deployment Issue Resolved

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The deployment was crashing with this error:
```
AssertionError: View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint function: get_expired_events
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The Flask application had **duplicate route definitions** for the same endpoints:

1. **Duplicate `/events/expired` route** - Two identical route definitions with the same function name `get_expired_events`
2. **Duplicate `/events/cleanup` route** - Two identical route definitions with the same function name `trigger_event_cleanup`

Flask doesn't allow duplicate endpoint names, which caused the application to crash during startup.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate `/events/expired` Route
- **Kept**: First occurrence (lines 1118-1150)
- **Removed**: Second occurrence (lines 1179-1210)

### 2. Removed Duplicate `/events/cleanup` Route  
- **Kept**: First occurrence (lines 1090-1120)
- **Removed**: Second occurrence (lines 1154-1184)

### 3. Fixed Missing Route Decorator
- Added missing `@app.route('/events/cleanup', methods=['POST'])` decorator to the first `trigger_event_cleanup` function

## 🧪 Verification

- ✅ Flask app imports successfully without errors
- ✅ No duplicate endpoint functions remain
- ✅ All routes are properly defined
- ✅ Application should now deploy without crashes

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fixed application** - The duplicate route issue is resolved
2. **Test the endpoints** to ensure they work correctly:
   - `GET /events/expired` - Get expired events count
   - `POST /events/cleanup` - Trigger manual cleanup
3. **Monitor deployment logs** to confirm no more startup errors

## 📝 Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app.py` - Removed duplicate route definitions

**Routes Affected:**
- `/events/expired` (GET) - Admin endpoint for viewing expired events
- `/events/cleanup` (POST) - Admin endpoint for manual event cleanup

The fix ensures that each endpoint has exactly one route definition, eliminating the Flask assertion error that was preventing deployment.
