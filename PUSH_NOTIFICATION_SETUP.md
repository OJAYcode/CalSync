## üö® Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå No Push Notifications

3. **FCM token is saved** (check browser console for "‚úÖ FCM token sent to backend")
4. **Event reminder time** has passed

### ‚ùå "FCM token sent to backend" Error
**Solution:**
1. **Check Railway logs** for backend errors
2. **Verify Firebase credentials** are correct
3. **Redeploy backend** after fixing environment variables

### ‚ùå Notifications Don't Appear on Phone
**Check these:**
1. **Browser notification permissions** are allowed
2. **Phone is not in Do Not Disturb mode**
3. **App is not blocked** in phone settings
4. **Try refreshing the page** and allowing notifications again

## üéâ Success Indicators

‚úÖ **Push notifications appear** on phone when events are due  
‚úÖ **Notifications work** even when app is closed  
‚úÖ **Railway logs show** "‚úÖ Push notification sent" messages  

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test with real events** and different reminder times
